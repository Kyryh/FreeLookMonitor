# FreeLookMonitor
Lethal Company mod that lets you move the monitor's camera

# Installation

Either:
- Use [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
- Manually install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) and place the mod (and the dependencies) in the `Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins` folder

# Usage

Use:
- `arrow keys` to move the camera
- `page up/down` to move the camera vertically
- `right/left bracket` to zoom in/out
- `del` to reset the position
- `ins` to reset the zoom

All the keybinds are completely configurable in the game options

There's also config for the camera move speed and zoom speed

The mod is completely client-side so only you need to have it installed
